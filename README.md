# Heart_disease_detection_system
This project is a Machine Learning-based Heart Disease Detection System that predicts the likelihood of heart disease using patient health data. The dataset was imported from Kaggle, and multiple supervised learning algorithms were applied and evaluated for performance.
<br>
A simple and interactive web-based UI was built using Streamlit in the Anaconda environment, allowing users to input health parameters and get real-time predictions.
